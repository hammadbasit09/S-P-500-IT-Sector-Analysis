Apple (AAPL) remains the revenue leader in the IT sector, generating ~$380B‚Äì$400B annually. Growth has been steady, and its scale remains unmatched among S&P 500 IT companies.

Microsoft (MSFT) has shown impressive growth, with revenues climbing from ~$210B in 2023 to nearly $280B in 2025, fueled by cloud computing, enterprise services, and AI adoption.

Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG) continues to hold the third position with ~$280B in 2025, supported by strong performance in digital ads, Google Cloud, and AI-driven products.

NVIDIA (NVDA), while historically much smaller in revenue than Apple or Microsoft, has experienced exponential growth over the last three years. Revenues surged past $50B by 2025, largely due to the booming demand for AI chips, data center GPUs, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA‚Äôs trajectory suggests it could soon join the very top tier of IT sector leaders.

üìä Together, these four companies showcase different growth stories: Apple‚Äôs scale, Microsoft‚Äôs steady enterprise expansion, Alphabet‚Äôs ad + cloud engine, and NVIDIA‚Äôs explosive rise in the AI era.
